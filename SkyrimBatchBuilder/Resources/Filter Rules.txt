Filters work based off of the source plugin from the item and the EditorID of the record

Rules:
1. Syntax "pluginName;EditorIDFilter;" Always add second semicolon. 
	Any filter with anything after the second semicolon other then a new line will be ignored.
	Make sure there is no space at the start or end of pluginName or EditorIDFilter.
		See rule 3 for exeption for spaces.

2. ".;Ench;" will filter all plugins and then any Editor ID with Ench in the name
	Danger: never ever do ".;;" this will funtionally filter every single item. There is a system to prevent this from happening 
			but its an extra filter that will still be checked.

3. some entries have 2 or 3 record's with similar EditorIDs
	Example dunMistwatchRing "Fjola's Wedding Band" [ARMO:000C0164] has an EditorID of dunMistwatchRing
		and dunMistwatchRingSell "Fjola's Wedding Band" [ARMO:000D3BDB] has an EditorID of dunMistwatchRingSell.
		Functionally there the same item but you will see 2 "Fjola's Wedding Band" so if you use the filter
		"Skyrim.esm;dunMistwatchRing ;" it will remove the version bethesda didn't want people to get being the
		dunMistwatchRing "Fjola's Wedding Band" [ARMO:000C0164].
